## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Queries
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### What I learned

During this project, I improved my understanding of how Flexbox works and how it can be used to build flexible and responsive layouts. Previously, I often relied on trial and error, but through this challenge I became more confident in using properties such as      `flex-direction`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-wrap` in a more intentional way.

I also learned how Flexbox can be combined with a mobile-first approach to progressively enhance the layout for larger screens using media queries.

Here is a simple example of Flexbox usage from this project:

```css
header .button {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to continue improving my layout logic, especially in deciding when to use Flexbox versus CSS Grid. I also plan to practice writing more efficient media queries to handle different screen sizes more smoothly.

In addition, I would like to focus on structuring my CSS in a cleaner and more scalable way as my projects become more complex, while maintaining a strong mobile-first workflow.
